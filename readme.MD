# Candy Machine Probability Project 

### This is a fork

This is a fork of TBWYO's GIRRLS project which currently contains a version of m2aenad's PST_task "probability task" python game modified by the CWC Computer Technology Lab. This fork adds brand new firmware for the adafruit blufruit nrf52832 controller board which powers the candy machine. The goal is to eventually merge this project into TBWYO's and finally m2aenad's project upon completeion. I highly reccomend you check out the other two projects mentioned for a better understanding of the project going forward.

The GIRRLS Project is a collaboration between Central Wyoming College and University of Wyoming. The project consists of three (3) parts, 
1) The Python Game 
2) The arduino electronics
3) The 3D printable chasis

### Python Game

To run the probability task, you will need to have Python 3.8.10 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3.8.10 from the official website and install the required libraries using the following command from the (project's) root directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Arduino Electronics

To flash your nrf52832 with our code you need to have the arduino IDE installed with the proper board manager and COM port set. More detailed instructions will be available as the project progresses. Until then you are on your own.
