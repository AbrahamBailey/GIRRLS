# Candy Machine Probability Project 

The GIRRLS Project is a collaboration between Central Wyoming College and University of Wyoming. The project consists of three (3) parts, 
1) The Python Game 
2) The arduino electronics
3) The 3D printable chasis

### Python Game

To run the probability task, you will need to have Python 3.8.10 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3.8.10 from the official website and install the required libraries using the following command from the (project's) root directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Arduino Electronics

To flash your nrf52832 with our code you need to have the arduino IDE installed with the proper board manager and COM port set. More detailed instructions will be available as the project progresses. Until then you are on your own.

### 3D Printable Chasis

More information soon to come
